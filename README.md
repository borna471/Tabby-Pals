#### Tabby Pals: The Fun and Casual Tab Tracking App for Friends!

Do you and your friends struggle to keep track of who paid for what when you go out? Tired of the tedious and awkward process of trying to split the tab? Introducing Tabby Pals - the fun, casual, and lighthearted app that makes tab splitting a breeze within your friend circle.

With our easy-to-use interface, you can quickly and easily input expenses and assign them to the appropriate friends. The app automatically calculates each person's share and keeps a running total of who owes what. Plus, our unique "Tab Leaderboard" feature lets you and your friends compete to see who can pay the most tabs in a given time period (and see who never pays their share)!

No more awkward conversations or forgetfulness. Just a simple and enjoyable way to keep track of your shared expenses with friends!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
