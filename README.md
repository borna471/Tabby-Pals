#### Tabby Pals: The Fun and Casual Tab Tracking App for Friends!

Do you and your friends struggle to keep track of who paid for what when you go out? Tired of the tedious and awkward process of trying to split the tab? Introducing Tabby Pals - the fun, casual, and lighthearted app that makes tab splitting a breeze within your friend circle.

With our easy-to-use interface, you can quickly and easily input expenses and assign them to the appropriate friends. The app automatically calculates each person's share and keeps a running total of who owes what. Plus, our unique "Tab Leaderboard" feature lets you and your friends compete to see who can pay the most tabs in a given time period (and see who never pays their share)!

No more awkward conversations or forgetfulness. Just a simple and enjoyable way to keep track of your shared expenses with friends!
